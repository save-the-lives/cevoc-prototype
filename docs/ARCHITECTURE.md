# Architecture

Hexagonal. Dependencies point inwards: `adapter` -> `application` -> `domain`. `ArchitectureTest` enforces this.

    backend/src/main/java/au/gov/nsw/transport/cevoc
      domain/                 records only, no framework
      application/port/in/    LookupPenaltyUseCase   (what the outside can ask)
      application/port/out/   PenaltyLookupPort      (how we get content)
      application/service/    LookupPenaltyService
      adapter/in/web/         REST controller (public, unauthenticated)
      adapter/out/stub/       StubPenaltyLookupAdapter (fictitious data, today)
      config/                 BeanConfig: the only place that chooses an adapter

## Swapping sources later
Select with `cevoc.penalty-lookup.adapter`. Planned adapters, none built yet:
- `revenue-nsw`: pass the notice number and offence date to the public Revenue NSW / Service NSW page and extract the returned content.
- `evidence-api`: real image, video and certificate APIs, with caching or buffering.

## Open questions
- How the Revenue NSW / Service NSW page accepts the two inputs, and whether it needs an identity step. Automated pass-through must be confirmed as permitted before building that adapter.
- The public certificates page (`/cevoc/pages/sdro/searchCertificates.jsf`) blocks automated fetching via robots.txt. Its form structure needs to be captured by a person.
